# wordpress-lti

This *LTI Connector for WordPress* is a WordPress plugin which allows the multisite versions of WordPress to act as an IMS LTI tool provider so that its blogs can be linked directly from a course in a VLE. LTI support can be found in most VLEs thereby enabling WordPress to be integrated with ease.

Visit the wiki for [documentation](wiki).  A zip file of the latest release of this connector can be found on the [OSCELOT project page](https://github.com/OSCELOT/wordpress-lti).
